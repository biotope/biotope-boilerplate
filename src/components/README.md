## Components

Components are the centerpiece of this frontend framework. 
During the last years we came up with a bunch of concepts and best practices to build frontend components that are modular, maintainable and highly variable.

To achieve this grade of flexibility we need to agree on some conventions that are described here:

### Component folder structure inside `/src/components/`

    .
    ├── componentName
    │   └── /hbs  # All handlebars partials used by the component
    │   └── /js  # JavaScript Plugins (deprecated, better use TS)
    │   └── /scaffolding  # Variations of the component and structure for demo pages
    │   └── /scss  # Stylesheet with BEM structure
    │   └── /ts  # TypeScript Plugins
    │   └── component.hbs  # The main component template


### Templates / Partials (Handlebars)


### CSS / SCSS


### JavaScript / TypeScript


### Data / JSON


### Scaffolding
